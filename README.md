# Handwriting-Analysis-for-Early-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction
Utilizing machine learning on the DARWIN dataset, we predict early Alzheimer's disease through handwriting analysis. XGBoost model achieves 91% accuracy, showcasing handwriting's potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Future work includes exploring advanced models for enhanced prediction.

#Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition affecting millions worldwide. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods can be costly and invasive. However, recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and handwriting analysis offer a promising avenue for non-invasive and accessible AD detection.

#Motivation
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze handwriting patterns for early AD prediction. Changes in handwriting have been correlated with cognitive decline in AD patients, making it a potential biomarker for early detection. By employing ML algorithms on handwriting data, we can identify patterns indicative of AD, facilitating timely intervention and improving patient care.
