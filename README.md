# Handwriting-Analysis-for-Early-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction
Utilizing machine learning on the DARWIN dataset, we predict early Alzheimer's disease through handwriting analysis. XGBoost model achieves 91% accuracy, showcasing handwriting's potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Future work includes exploring advanced models for enhanced prediction.
